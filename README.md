**GCNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Grape Cluster Segmentation and Yield Estimation Incorporating Occluded Grape Detection with a Correction Factor for Indoor Experimentation
**
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks designed for tasks related to grape image analysis, specifically:

1. TestSegmentation_Final.ipynb: Implements and tests segmentation algorithms for grape clusters.
2. GenerateGrapeCountThesis_Final.ipynb: Focuses on detecting and counting grapes for thesis purposes.

Prerequisites

Libraries and Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebooks:

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab



Data
Ensure you have access to GrapeSet or any other dataset containing images of grapes for counting and segmentation.

Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/rubiquinones/GCNet

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

3. Open and run the desired notebook:
   - Firstly, for segmentation, use `TestSegmentation_Final.ipynb`.
   - Then, for grape counting, use `GenerateGrapeCountThesis_Final.ipynb`.
